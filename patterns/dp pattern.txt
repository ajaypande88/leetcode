Linear Dp link
This type of questions are easy to figure out. You just need to find the repetitive part of soultion and improve it by saving its result somewhere. A classical example is fibonacci series.

String and Dp link
In interviews or contests, problems on string are really common and one has to be strong on this. To make problem more complex soultion requires backtracking or recursion, after that dp can be applied to optimize further.

Dp with Tree and Graph link
Tree and Graph are maily based of DFS and BFS. Its very rare to see some direct relation with dp. But for best understanding one should practise hard with BFS, DFS and other direct graph based algo. Then you can provide some advance solution with dp. I would recommend to start with problem Cheapest Flights Within K Stops ( problem 787).

Knapsack based Dp link
Solution is built upon subset, but with few more restrictions. For example you want to complete some courses, they have some reward points associated. But you can attend only k number of courses. Now try to maximize your points. This type of problems are just extension to simple dp, where you add one more dimension to consider provided restriction.

Dp with bits manipulation link
Usually we create array or map to store computed state. But Some problems may need you to save space further more by just encoding state and its result into bits. Solve some problems in this list you will realize bits are so powerful.

Dp on math problems link
These are rare in interview, so one can start this list accordingly. But if you are a math lover, its a great category.

Classical dp problems link
Its a must do list. It consits many direct interview question. You will find them as it is. Also these question are base to your understanding. It will help in logic building in contests too. I suggest solve these problems several times. Its like Inception movie.

Grid based dp link
Grid based questions are easy to solve. It just require practise.

Multidimensional Dp link

Digit problems with dp link

Interval problems with dp link

Later I'll add more lists based on selected problems in other categories. Suggestions are most welcome.

Approach - Drawback of solving problems topic wise is, we think in narrow space and do not consider other approaches. So always question yourself why are you using this approach. Also always use timer while practising.
