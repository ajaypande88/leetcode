Job scheduling can be sorted either by start time or end time depending on the optimization criteria.

Sorting by Start Time:

If the goal is to maximize resource utilization, sort by start time.
This scheduling method schedules the jobs with the earliest start time first, ensuring that resources are utilized as soon as they become available.
Sorting by End Time:

If the goal is to minimize the number of conflicts, sort by end time.
This scheduling method schedules the jobs with the earliest end time first, reducing the chances of two jobs overlapping and conflicting.
